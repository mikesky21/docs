# Implementation Guide

Information for partners who will integrate Fractal's features into their apps.

This guide provides partners with all the information to set up, test, and launch Fractal integration as part of their application. This process includes four main phases:

1. [Pre-Implementation](#pre-implementation) - Work with Fractal to create a Scope of Work describing your integration and identifying requirements across the Fractal Platform.
2. [Sandbox Setup](#sandbox-setup) - In the Fractal Sandbox environment, you will define the settings and workflows utilized in the platform features of Fractal for your integration.
   - Merchant Boarding
   - Payment Acceptance
   - Fees and Billing
   - Funding
3. [Testing and Migration](#testing-and-migration) - Once your sandbox application is set up, Fractal will help to test and migrate your implementation to the Fractal Production environment.
4. [Merchant Support Features](#merchant-support-features) - Enabling Fractal Merchant Support features gives your merchants the ability to manage disputes and run reports.

The diagram below illustrates how the Payments Integration and Merchant Support features work together to provide the benefits of the Fractal platform:

# Pre-Implementation

This resource outlines the Scope of Work requirements pre-Implementation.

All integrating Partners and software platforms work with the Fractal Solution Engineers and Sales Team to create a Scope of Work that describes what your integration will look like and the associated requirements across the Fractal Platform.

During Pre-Implementation, you will work with a Fractal Solution Engineer to fill in the [Partner Pre-Integration Form](https://example.com). This page includes details about all of the information that you will need to provide on the form.
